# **Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Lecture Summarization**

## **Introduction**

In the realm of education, **distilling lectures into concise, informative summaries** remains a significant challenge. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for automating this task, potentially transforming how students engage with educational content. This project, conducted by Team 26, explores the application of LLMs to the task of lecture summarization, aiming to assess and compare the performance of various LLMs in this unique domain.

### **Project Objectives**

- **To benchmark the performance of different LLMs** on lecture summarization.
- **To explore the effectiveness** of fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot learning approaches.
- **To evaluate the potential of LLMs** to produce high-quality educational summaries that could aid in learning and knowledge retention.

## **Methodology**

### **Dataset**

The project utilizes the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** for pretraining and benchmarking, given its widespread use in text summarization tasks. This choice facilitates a focused evaluation of the LLMs' summarization capabilities on lecture content extracted from class recordings.

### **Models Evaluated**

- **BART (406M)**: Leverages a seq2seq architecture with a bidirectional encoder and a left-to-right decoder.
- **GPT-2 (774M)**: Known for its powerful text generation capabilities using a decoder architecture.
- **Llama 2 (7B)** and **Gemma (2B)**: Represent Meta AI and Google AI's advancements in efficient and scalable language models, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

### **Performance Metrics**

The project adopts **ROUGE, BLEU, and BERT-Score metrics** to evaluate the models' performance. These metrics provide insights into the models' accuracy, structural similarity, and the semantic coherence of the generated summaries.

## **Results**

The results highlight **a correlation between the number of parameters in an LLM and its summarization performance**. Interestingly, for Llama2 and Gemma, zero-shot and few-shot learning approaches yielded comparable performance to fine-tuned models. This suggests that LLMs possess inherent capabilities that, with proper prompt engineering, can be leveraged for effective summarization without extensive fine-tuning.

## **Discussion**

### **Limitations**

- **Resource Constraints**: The limited availability of GPU resources necessitated the use of LoRA quantization and smaller batch sizes, potentially impacting the models' performance.
- **Metric Limitations**: The chosen evaluation metrics were insufficient to capture certain nuances, such as awkward sentence structures or grammatical errors, underscoring the need for human evaluation.
- **Output Variability**: Inherent randomness in LLM outputs required the averaging of results across multiple trials to ascertain reliable performance benchmarks.

### **Implications**

The findings underscore **the significant potential of LLMs in educational applications**, particularly in automating the summarization of lecture content. Furthermore, the minimal performance difference between fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot learning approaches opens up possibilities for deploying these models in resource-constrained environments.

## **Conclusion**

This project has demonstrated **the viability of using LLMs for the summarization of lecture content**, marking a promising step towards enhancing educational resources. The ability of models like Llama2 and Gemma to perform remarkably well, despite differences in their sizes, highlights the advancements in LLM technologies and their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moving forward, further research is needed to overcome the identified limitations and fully harness the capabilities of LLMs in education.
